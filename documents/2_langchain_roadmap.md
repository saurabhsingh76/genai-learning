# Langchain Learning Roadmap

## What is Langchain?
Langchain is an open-source framework that helps in building applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides modular components and end-to-end tools that enable developers to build complex AI applications such as chatbots, question answering systems, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), autonomous agents, and more.

## Core Features of Langchain
1. **Supports all major LLMs**  
   Works seamlessly with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.
2. **Simplifies LLM application development**  
   - Concepts like *chains* help build complex pipelines to create sophisticated applications.
3. **Wide Integration Support**  
   - Provides wrappers to connect easily to databases, remote data sources, cloud services (e.g., AWS) and more without writing boilerplate code.
4. **Open source, free, and actively developed**
5. **Supports major Generative AI use cases**  
   Such as chatbots, agents, and RAG-based applications.
