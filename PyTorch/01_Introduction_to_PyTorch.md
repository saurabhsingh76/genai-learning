# PyTorch Introduction and Complete Guide

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an **open-source Python-based deep learning library** that enables you to build powerful neural network applications. Since the boom of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), PyTorch has become the **de facto deep learning library** for building LLM applications, making it extremely important in the current AI landscape.

## Journey of PyTorch

### Origin Story (2002 - 2017)

#### The Beginning: Torch Framework (2002)
- **Torch** was a powerful scientific computing framework introduced in 2002
- Key capabilities:
  - Tensor-based operations
    - What is Tensor? A tensor is fundamentally a multidimensional array (or n-dimensional array) that can hold numerical data. We will discuss more about tensors in next notes.
  - GPU support for tensor computations
    - Tensors enable massive parallel computations on GPUs/TPUs
    - Instead of processing data sequentially, entire tensor operations happen simultaneously
  - Used by deep learning researchers for building neural networks (AlexNet, VGGNet implementations)

#### Problems with Torch
1. **Lua-based Framework**: Required learning Lua programming language, creating friction for developers
2. **Static Computation Graphs**: Once a model was built, the computation graph was fixed and couldn't be modified

#### Birth of PyTorch (2017)
- Meta AI researchers identified the problems with existing frameworks
- **Solution**: Merge Torch's powerful capabilities with Python's simplicity
- **PyTorch = Product of marriage between Torch and Python**
